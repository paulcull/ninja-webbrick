Ninja WebBrick Module
=====================

=====================

This is a module for the now defunct H2M8 home automation
system. The WebBricks are the units controlling the 
physical system

It is highly unlikely that anyone will have one of these
systems, but you may be able to re-use some of this for
other projects

This supports the mapping of devices to the physical units
as well as a UDP processes for events from the webBricks
